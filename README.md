This is my own aladeen news app from the movie "The Dictator" that stars Sacha Baron Cohen.

I just remembered Sacha baron cohen in the movie from Elon musk's rocket.
The one that says too round and it needs to be pointy.
Then i found something to see and to make an app about.
the joke about aladeen is not about a person but the whole wadiya english dictionary was changed to aladeen including positive and negative.
Well if you're confused just search up the aladeen news in youtube so you might have a good day.


Not political and its a movie reference.
i make references in my apps.
